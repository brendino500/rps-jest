## 🌝 Overview

[View my project](https://rpc-bt.netlify.app/)

- I decided to code this project as I wanted to **continue my learning in Jest, Enzyme and React Hooks.**
- Over the last few months I had coded rock paper scissors **three different times with each new version implementing a new technology I had learnt.**
- 1. HTML, CSS & vanilla JavaScript
- 2. Implementation of SASS
- 3. React
- 4. Test Driven Development (TDD) (this project)
- This proved a nice challenge as I didn't have to think about the logic, so I could **concentrate on implementing the new technology.**

## 💻 Technologies & Tools

- Jest & Enzyme
- React (Hooks)
- Material UI

## 💡 Process

- As this was TDD I had **written all the tests out before**. As I had never really done any testing before this project, this was a good process to change mindset.
- I also used red to green testing to check failing tests.
- After all the tests were complete I had then started to style the single page.

## 💬 Comments

- This project took me longer than expected as when I started coding it was **really evident that you can write a test for absolutely anyting.**
